## Inspiration
Sometimes an individual can get overwhelmed with the amount of medication they take and being able to have a clear layout of all their medications allows them to be more organized and relieve stress. Also some individuals are hesitant to take medications due to a fear in potential side effects and long-term effects. Being able to have a list of all potential side effects from the medication they are taking and tracking their symptoms can help them be aware of something wrong and they should seek medical care.

## What it does
MediMatch allows users to log all their medications by inputting information like the name, dosage and frequency of use. It also lists the potential side effects of the medication and allows users to log and keep track of their symptoms.

## How we built it
We used React to show the front end, and used Python and MongoDB to power the backend. We hosted MediMatch on Render.

## Challenges we ran into
Connecting the frontend and backend proved to be a big challenge as our two teams were pretty separate before meeting back together and making it work. However, we eventually connected them and got things working smoothly as planned.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully built a full-stack healthcare web app using FastAPI for the backend and React + Vite for the frontend — deployed on Render with real-time database integration via MongoDB. We also integrated Google Gemini as an AI assistant to help users with healthcare info. We're also happy we deployed within a tight timeframe, with features including user authentication, dynamic medication tracking, and API-powered health insights.

## What we learned
We learned how a web app comes together and is built. We became more familiar with working with React and MongoDB. We also gained more experience in working in a collaborative setting.

## What's next for MediMatch
MediMatch has plans to evolve by being able to notify users of dangerous interactions between the medications they are taking. MediMatch will have a functional alert system that alerts users about any dangerous interactions with other medicine and notifies them if a symptom matches with a side effect.
